# nonprofit
The non-profit of the future is open-sourced, driven by volunteers who freely give of themselves to shape a world where the least among us are cared for, and no one is ever alone. It envisions a world where food, clothing, shelter, resources, and time are shared with anyone, anywhere, regardless of beliefs, religion, sex, status, race, or gender.
